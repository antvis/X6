## Configuring Connection Ports

First, we group connection ports that have the same behavior and appearance into the same group, and set the grouping using the `groups` option, which is an object `{ [groupName: string]: PortGroupMetadata }`. The group name is the key, and the value is the default options for each group of connection ports. The supported options are as follows:

```ts
interface PortGroupMetadata {
  markup?: Markup // Definition of the connection port DOM structure.
  attrs?: Attr.CellAttrs // Attributes and styles.
  zIndex?: number | 'auto' // The DOM layer level of the connection port; the higher the value, the higher the level.
  // Layout of connection ports in the group.
  position?: [number, number] | string | { name: string; args?: object }
  label?: {
    // Connection port label
    markup?: Markup
    position?: {
      // Layout of the connection port label
      name: string // Layout name
      args?: object // Layout parameters
    }
  }
}
```

Next, we configure `items`, which is an array `PortMetadata[]`. Each item in the array represents a connection port, and the supported options for connection ports are as follows:

```ts
interface PortMetadata {
  id?: string // Unique ID for the connection port, automatically generated by default.
  group?: string // Group name; specifying a group will inherit the options of the connection ports in that group.
  args?: object // Parameters for the layout algorithm specified for the connection ports in the group. We cannot specify a layout algorithm for a single connection port, but we can provide different parameters for the layout algorithm specified for the group.
  markup?: Markup // Definition of the connection port's DOM structure. Specifying this option will override the default options provided by the group referred to by `group`.
  attrs?: Attr.CellAttrs // Element's attribute styles. Specifying this option will override the default options provided by the group referred to by `group`.
  zIndex?: number | 'auto' // The DOM layer level of the connection port; the higher the value, the higher the level. Specifying this option will override the default options provided by the group referred to by `group`.
  label?: {
    // Label for the connection port. Specifying this option will override the default options provided by the group referred to by `group`.
    markup?: Markup // Label DOM structure
    position?: {
      // Label position
      name: string // Name of the label position calculation method
      args?: object // Parameters for the label position calculation method
    }
  }
}
```

The following example code clearly shows how to define connection ports.

## Modifying Connection Ports

There is a rich [API](/en/api/model/node#connection-ports) for adding, deleting, and modifying connection ports on nodes.

```ts
// Add a connection port
node.addPort({
  group: 'top',
  attrs: {
    text: {
      text: 'xx',
    },
  },
})

// Remove a connection port
node.removePort(portId)

// Update a connection port
node.portProp(portId, 'attrs/circle/stroke', color)
```

<code id="port-prop" src="@/src/tutorial/basic/ports/dynamic/index.tsx"></code>

## Connection Port Position

The layout algorithm for connection ports can only be specified through the `position` option in `groups`, as the layout algorithm needs to consider all connection ports in the group when calculating their positions. We can influence the layout result of a single connection port through the `args` option.

We provide the following layout algorithms for connection ports by default, and also support [custom connection port layout algorithms and registration](/en/api/registry/port-layout#registry). Click the links below to learn how to use each layout algorithm.

- [`absolute`](/en/api/registry/port-layout#absolute) Absolute positioning.
- [`left`](/en/api/registry/port-layout#left-right-top-bottom) Evenly distributed on the left side of rectangular nodes.
- [`right`](/en/api/registry/port-layout#left-right-top-bottom) Evenly distributed on the right side of rectangular nodes.
- [`top`](/en/api/registry/port-layout#left-right-top-bottom) Evenly distributed on the top of rectangular nodes.
- [`bottom`](/en/api/registry/port-layout#left-right-top-bottom) Evenly distributed on the bottom of rectangular nodes.
- [`line`](/en/api/registry/port-layout#line) Evenly distributed along a specified line.
- [`ellipse`](/en/api/registry/port-layout#ellipse) Distributed along an elliptical arc.
- [`ellipseSpread`](/en/api/registry/port-layout#ellipsespread) Evenly distributed along an ellipse.

## Connection Port Label Position

The position of the label can be specified in both the `label.position` option of `groups` and the `items.label.position` option of the node.

We provide the following label positions by default, and also support [custom label positions and registration](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#registry). Click the links below to learn how to use each label position.

- [`left`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#side) The label is located on the left side of the connection port.
- [`right`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#side) The label is located on the right side of the connection port.
- [`top`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#side) The label is located above the connection port.
- [`bottom`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#side) The label is located below the connection port.
- [`inside`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#insideoutside) The label is located inside the node (close to the edge).
- [`outside`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#insideoutside) The label is located outside the node (close to the edge).
- [`insideOriented`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#insideoutside) The label is located inside the node and automatically adjusts the text direction based on its position.
- [`outsideOriented`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#insideoutside) The label is located outside the node and automatically adjusts the text direction based on its position.
- [`radial`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#radial) The label is located outside circular or elliptical nodes.
- [`radialOriented`](/en/api/registry/port-label-layout#radial) The label is located outside circular or elliptical nodes and the label text automatically rotates along the arc direction.
